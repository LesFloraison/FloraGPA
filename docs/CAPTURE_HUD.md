# Native capture HUD

Implementation branch: `feature/dx11-capture`. This work is separate from
legacy migration parity and the six-frame GF2 acceptance. Delivery is incomplete.

## Control foundation

`FloraCaptureHud` owns mode, configurable hotkey validation, foreground/rising-edge
input decisions, monotonic per-swap FPS samples and expiring messages. It has no
dependency on Qt, Replay, Core, the file format, capture recording or GPA.
Runtime composition will connect this model to presentation and capture control.

IPC and future input handling share `submit_capture_request`: one busy check,
capability/foreground selection, UUID validation, output naming and arm operation.
Disconnect permanently disables the service while existing wrappers keep forwarding.

Foundation verification: `capture_hud_model`, `capture_boundaries`,
`capture_controller` and `capture_bootstrap` pass in the capture-only Release build.
The existing injected controller matrix still runs through the shared request service.
No HUD is drawn by this foundation change.

## Presentation investigation

`FloraCaptureHudBufferProbe` is a native development experiment, not a runtime
dependency or an acceptance test. Ignored results:
`artifacts/capture-hud-buffer-probe.json` and
`artifacts/capture-hud-buffer-probe-slots.json`.

On the local NVIDIA device, three-buffer SEQUENTIAL and FLIP_SEQUENTIAL preserve
the COM identity of GetBuffer(0), but rotate its contents after successful Present.
The submitted image becomes logical slot 2. Copying a backup to the retained
GetBuffer(0) therefore restores the wrong buffer. Attempted copies to the other
slots do not restore their pixels. FLIP_DISCARD rejects GetBuffer(1/2).
Single-buffer DISCARD accepted restoration in this small experiment.
These observations do not establish a general safe restoration algorithm, nor
exclusive-fullscreen, failed-Present or retained-content acceptance.

An unsafe presentation path must skip HUD before drawing and report its reason.
No change may assume that stable COM identity implies stable physical storage.

## Reference research

Read-only Ghidra inspection of GPA 2025 R1 `shimd3d64.dll`:
SHA-256 `cb0b99d113511cbf7ca9f949d97aa02e4a1f8f110b1f3ad3165d8a81035dee31`.
Raw output is ignored under `artifacts/capture-hud-plan`.

* RVA 0x329270: HUD manager brackets view drawing with renderer virtual calls
  at offsets 0x38 and 0x40.
* RVA 0x328970: monotonic elapsed-time FPS refresh at approximately one second.
* RVA 0x327430: DX11 renderer initialization through 0x337d60; Arial view setup.
* RVA 0x2ff200: `GPA::DrawHUD` path temporarily changes a recording-related
  global around HUD rendering. This alone proves neither clean backbuffer
  restoration nor clean retained contents on subsequent frames.
* RVA 0x3000d0: frame/capture boundary work precedes the HUD call.

Original binaries, fonts and shaders are not product dependencies or copied assets.
The [Intel HUD reference](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/gpa/user-guide/2025-1/heads-up-display-hud-ui-reference.html)
describes the default mode/capture shortcuts and FPS timing.

## Outstanding gates

Native drawing and pixel restoration; protocol/configuration and Qt controls;
real input and visual verification; deterministic retained-content and exclusive
fullscreen tests; file inventory and dual-player isolation; GF2 start-screen HUD
capture and main-scene MSAA refusal. Formal GF2 acceptance remains 0/6.
